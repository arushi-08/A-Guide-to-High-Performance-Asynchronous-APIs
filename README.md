# A Guide to High Performance Asynchronous APIs

A guide to developing a robust web application capable of handling batch processing tasks through asynchronous calls, following the Publisher-Subscriber design pattern. The application leverages the highly-essential tools to get the ground running for efficient and scalable processing of large datasets.
Key Features: \
Asynchronous Task Execution: Utilize Celery, a powerful distributed task queue, to offload time-consuming batch processing tasks from the main application thread, ensuring responsiveness and optimal performance.
Publisher-Subscriber Pattern: Implement a decoupled architecture by adopting the Publisher-Subscriber design pattern, enabling seamless communication between different components of the system.
Reliable Message Queueing: Leverage Redis, an in-memory data structure store, as a reliable and high-performance message broker for efficient task distribution and management.
Persistent Data Storage: Integrate MongoDB, a flexible and scalable NoSQL database, to store and retrieve processed data, ensuring data integrity and enabling efficient querying.
Containerized Deployment: Package the entire application stack using Docker containers, facilitating consistent and reproducible deployments across different environments, from development to production.


**Technologies Used**
Celery: Employ Celery, a robust and efficient distributed task queue system, to execute batch processing tasks asynchronously, ensuring optimal resource utilization and scalability.
Redis: Leverage Redis, an in-memory data structure store, as a reliable and high-performance message broker for efficient task distribution and management.
MongoDB: Integrate MongoDB, a flexible and scalable NoSQL database, to store and retrieve processed data, enabling efficient querying and data manipulation.
Docker: Package and deploy the entire application stack using Docker containers, ensuring consistent and reproducible deployments across different environments.
